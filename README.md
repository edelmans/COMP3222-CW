## DESCRIPTION
This individual project was set with an aim to explore ways of automatically classifying Twitter news related content as real or fake. Within this coursework, I designed a machine learning algorithm for classifying Twitter posts from MediaEval 2015 "verifying multimedia use" challenge dataset.
The project was based on Python and Jupyter Notebook, along with the use of scikit-learn library, numpy, pandas and deep translator.
The dataset contained 14,277 training data entries and 3755 testing data entries, and each entry had the following set of features:

tweetId / tweetText / userId / imageId / username / timestamp / label
